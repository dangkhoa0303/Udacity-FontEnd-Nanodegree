			<p>The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the IUCN,
				having seen a major population decline in its African range of 30â€“50% per two decades during the second half of the twentieth century.
				Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood,
				habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern.
				Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.</p>
