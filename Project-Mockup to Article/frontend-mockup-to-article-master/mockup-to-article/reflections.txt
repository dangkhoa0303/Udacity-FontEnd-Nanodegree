I have learnt 2 new tags: <hr> which is the horizontal line and <sup> which is the supscript
I have known some basic html tags like the header tags, p tag as well as the div and form tags. So, 
I found this project was quite easy in making separate paragraphs with p tags.
Honestly, in my perspective, this project is not challenging. However, I need to look up for new tags that I don't.
After all, thanks to this project, I know how to use 2 new tags: <hr> and <sup>
